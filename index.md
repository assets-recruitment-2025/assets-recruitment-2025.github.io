<p>
    Including participants with disabilities is crucial for accessibility-focused research. Recruiting from disability communities can present challenges that require careful consideration of ethical practices, intersectional representation, methodological rigor, and community sustainability. Researchers may face tensions between meaningfully including participants with disabilities and addressing concerns such as whether participants adequately represent the diversity of the community, whether certain participants may be overburdened, and how to verify and compensate participants fairly.
</p>
<p>
    This workshop will bring together members of the ASSETS community to discuss current recruiting practices and identify insights into ethical, rigorous, and inclusive participant recruitment in disability research. We will explore three main topics:
</p>
<ul class="section-list">
  <li>Recruitment methods and models</li>
  <li>Eligibility criteria and participant verification</li>
  <li>Ethical and sustainability considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The workshop aims to share current practices, identify key challenges, and develop preliminary guidelines to support accessibility researchers in more sustainable participant recruitment.

    <strong>“Nothing about us without us”</strong> emphasizes the importance of including disability communities at every stage of computing accessibility research. However, recruiting participants with disabilities presents a range of challenges, including defining recruitment criteria, verifying eligibility, addressing ethical concerns, sustaining engagement, and navigating the tension between genuine inclusion and avoiding both tokenism and participant over-burdening.
</p>
<p>
    We invite participation from a diverse group of accessibility researchers to share current challenges and practices in participant recruitment and to collaboratively envision the future of inclusive recruitment. We believe this conversation will make a timely and valuable contribution to the field.
</p>
<p>
    We welcome submissions and participation from researchers across all career stages, disciplines, and geographic regions, with particular encouragement for those from the Global South, non-Western countries, and those whose work addresses the unique needs and contexts of these regions. We recognize that accessibility research has historically centered Western and Global North perspectives, and we seek to amplify a broader range of voices.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our workshop is part of the ASSETS’25 conference.</strong> ASSETS is an ACM conference: the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest educational computing society. Although you do not have to register for the full conference to register for the workshop, we encourage you to register and attend the full ASSETS’25 conference!

    <strong>Attendee Selection: </strong>Given the size of our team, the limitations of providing an accessible experience in an online format, and the need to ensure manageable group sizes for both combined and breakout discussions, we are aiming for a maximum of <strong>30 participants</strong>. The minimum eligibility criterion for participation in the workshop is <strong>experience recruiting human participants in at least one disability- or accessibility-related research study.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If we receive more than 30 eligible applications, we will evaluate responses to the Google Form. At least two members of our team will review all form responses against three criteria:
</p>
<ul class="section-list">
  <li>The attendee reflected on how their prior experience aligns with the workshop.</li>
  <li>The attendee explained what they will contribute to the workshop.</li>
  <li>The attendee will contribute a diverse perspective to the workshop discussions.</li>
</ul>
