<p>
    Including participants with disabilities is crucial for accessibility-focused research. Recruiting from disability communities can present challenges that require careful consideration of ethical practices, intersectional representation, methodological rigor, and community sustainability. Researchers may face tensions between meaningfully including participants with disabilities and addressing concerns such as whether participants adequately represent the diversity of the community, whether certain participants may be overburdened, and how to verify and compensate participants fairly.
</p>
<p>
    This workshop will bring together members of the ASSETS community to discuss current recruiting practices and identify insights into ethical, rigorous, and inclusive participant recruitment in disability research. We will explore three main topics:
</p>
<ul class="section-list">
  <li>Recruitment methods and models</li>
  <li>Eligibility criteria and participant verification</li>
  <li>Ethical and sustainability considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The workshop aims to share current practices, identify key challenges, and develop preliminary guidelines to support accessibility researchers in more sustainable participant recruitment.

      <p><em>“Nothing about us without us”</em> calls for including disability communities at every stage of computing accessibility research. Recruiting participants brings challenges around conceptualizing recruiting criteria, verification, ethics, and balancing genuine inclusion with avoiding tokenism and participant over‑burden.</p>
      <p>This virtual workshop will focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recruitment methods & models tailored for participants with disabilities</li>
        <li>How eligibility criteria are conceptualized & verified amid tensions between various disability models</li>
        <li>Ethical considerations for sustainable engagement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will run the workshop online via Zoom across three sessions during the week of October 20–25. Participants will be selected via a Google Form where they share:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their experiences recruiting for at least one computing accessibility study</li>
        <li>Perspectives related to the three workshop themes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We encourage submissions from researchers at all career stages, with emphasis on diverse geographic, cultural, and smaller‑population perspectives.</p>
      <p>All selected participants must register through ASSETS and actively contribute to discussions. We promise an engaging, inclusive environment to collaboratively shape best practices.</p>

      <h3>Attendee Selection</h3>
      <p>We’re capping the workshop at <strong>30 participants</strong> to ensure manageable group sizes and an accessible experience online. Minimum eligibility: experience recruiting human participants in at least one disability‑ or accessibility‑related research study (others will be desk rejected).</p>
      <p>If we receive more than 30 eligible applications, at least two organizers will independently rate each on a 5‑point scale (“Strongly Disagree” → “Strongly Agree”) against these questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The attendee’s prior experience aligns with the workshop themes.</li>
        <li>The attendee described what they’ll contribute to the workshop.</li>
        <li>The attendee brings a diverse perspective to our discussions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Should we need further deliberation, we’ll hold a quick synchronous meeting to finalize the attendee list.</p>
