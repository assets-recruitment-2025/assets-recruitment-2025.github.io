<p>
    Including participants with disabilities is crucial for accessibility-focused research. Recruiting from disability communities can present challenges that require careful consideration of ethical practices, intersectional representation, methodological rigor, and community sustainability. Researchers may face tensions between meaningfully including participants with disabilities and addressing concerns such as whether participants adequately represent the diversity of the community, whether certain participants may be overburdened, and how to verify and compensate participants fairly.
</p>
<p>
    This workshop will bring together members of the ASSETS community to discuss current recruiting practices and identify insights into ethical, rigorous, and inclusive participant recruitment in disability research. We will explore three main topics:
</p>
<ul class="section-list">
  <li>Recruitment methods and models</li>
  <li>Eligibility criteria and participant verification</li>
  <li>Ethical and sustainability considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The workshop aims to share current practices, identify key challenges, and develop preliminary guidelines to support accessibility researchers in more sustainable participant recruitment.

<p>
    Our workshop aims to address these critical issues related to participant recruitment by fostering discussion around how to effectively and ethically recruit participants with disabilities for accessibility research studies. We invite participation from a diverse group of accessibility researchers to share current challenges and practices in participant recruitment and to collaboratively envision the future of inclusive recruitment. We believe this conversation will make a timely and valuable contribution to the field.
</p>
<p>
    We welcome submissions and participation from researchers across all career stages, disciplines, and geographic regions, with particular encouragement for those from the Global South, non-Western countries, and those whose work addresses the unique needs and contexts of these regions. We recognize that accessibility research has historically centered Western and Global North perspectives, and we seek to amplify a broader range of voices.
